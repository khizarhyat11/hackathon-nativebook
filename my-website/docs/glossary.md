# Glossary

Essential terms and definitions for Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.

## A

**Actuator** - A device that converts energy into physical motion. Examples include electric motors, hydraulic cylinders, and pneumatic pistons.

**Agent** - An autonomous entity that perceives its environment and takes actions to achieve goals.

**AI-Native** - Content or systems designed from the ground up to leverage AI capabilities, including AI-assisted learning and processing.

## B

**Behavior Tree** - A modular, hierarchical control structure for AI decision-making that combines reactive and deliberative elements.

**BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention)** - An agent architecture that models rational behavior through beliefs about the world, desires to achieve, and intentions to act.

## C

**Configuration Space (C-Space)** - The space of all possible robot configurations, where each point represents a unique set of joint angles.

**Control Loop** - A continuous cycle of sensing, computing, and acting that maintains desired robot behavior.

## D

**Degrees of Freedom (DOF)** - The number of independent parameters needed to specify a robot's configuration. A 6-DOF robot arm can position and orient its end-effector in 3D space.

**Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) Parameters** - A standardized convention for describing the geometry of serial robot manipulators.

## E

**Embodiment** - The principle that an agent's physical form (body) shapes its interaction with the world and influences its intelligence.

**End-Effector** - The device at the end of a robot arm that interacts with the environment (e.g., gripper, tool, sensor).

## F

**Forward Kinematics (FK)** - Computing the end-effector pose given joint angles.

**Foundation Model** - A large AI model trained on broad data that can be adapted for various downstream tasks.

## G

**Grasp Planning** - The process of determining how to position a gripper to successfully pick up an object.

## H

**Humanoid Robot** - A robot with a body shape designed to resemble the human form, typically with a head, torso, two arms, and two legs.

**Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)** - A software layer that provides a consistent interface to hardware, hiding device-specific details.

## I

**Inverse Kinematics (IK)** - Computing the joint angles required to achieve a desired end-effector pose.

**IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)** - A sensor that measures acceleration and angular velocity, used for orientation estimation.

## J

**Jacobian** - A matrix relating joint velocities to end-effector velocities, fundamental to robot motion control.

## K

**Kinematics** - The study of motion without considering forces. Describes the relationship between joint angles and robot configuration.

## L

**LiDAR** - Light Detection and Ranging. A sensor that uses laser pulses to measure distances and create 3D maps.

## M

**Motion Planning** - Finding a collision-free path from start configuration to goal configuration.

**Multi-Agent System** - A system composed of multiple interacting autonomous agents.

## P

**Perception** - The process of converting raw sensor data into meaningful representations of the environment.

**Physical AI** - Artificial intelligence systems that interact with the physical world through sensors and actuators.

**Pose** - A complete description of position and orientation in 3D space (6 values: x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw).

## R

**Reality Gap** - The discrepancy between simulated and real-world behavior that can cause policies trained in simulation to fail on real robots.

**ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2)** - An open-source middleware framework for robot software development.

**RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree)** - A sampling-based motion planning algorithm that builds a tree of random configurations.

## S

**Sensor Fusion** - Combining data from multiple sensors to achieve more accurate and reliable perception.

**Series Elastic Actuator (SEA)** - An actuator with an intentional spring between motor and output, enabling precise force control and safer human interaction.

**SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)** - Building a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously tracking the robot's location within it.

**Symbiosis** - In this context, the collaborative partnership between humans, AI agents, and robots.

## T

**Teleoperation** - Remote control of a robot by a human operator.

**Trajectory** - A time-parameterized path that specifies positions, velocities, and accelerations over time.

**Transformation Matrix** - A 4×4 matrix representing both rotation and translation in 3D space.

## W

**Workspace** - The volume of space that a robot's end-effector can reach.
