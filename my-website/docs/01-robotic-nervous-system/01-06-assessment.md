# Assessment & Deliverables

## Deliverables

- A GitHub PR containing:
  - `hello_robot` node (Python) with clear README and run instructions
  - Minimal biped URDF/XACRO that loads in `rviz2`
  - Short demo video (screen capture) of node + URDF in simulator
- Optional: Unit tests for node behavior and CI that builds documentation

## Grading Rubric

- Functionality (50%): Node runs, topics available, URDF loads
- Clarity (20%): README, code comments, reproducibility
- Safety (20%): Safety checks, disabled motors, E-stop instructions
- Bonus (10%): Tests, CI, or additional sensors simulated

## Submission

Open a PR to the course repo under `modules/01-robotic-nervous-system/` and include a link to the demo video and instructions to reproduce locally.
